# Lockboxes

## Introduction
This Python program checks whether all the boxes in a collection of locked boxes can be opened by using the keys contained within them. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1, and each box may contain keys to other boxes.

## Functionality
The program provides a method `canUnlockAll(boxes)` that takes a list of lists as input, where each inner list represents a box and contains the keys to other boxes. The function returns True if all boxes can be opened, otherwise it returns False.

### Prototype:
```python
def canUnlockAll(boxes)
```

### Parameters:
- `boxes`: A list of lists where each inner list represents a box and contains the keys to other boxes.

### Returns:
- `True` if all boxes can be opened.
- `False` otherwise.

## Examples
```python
boxes1 = [[1], [2], [3], [4], []]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes1))  # Output: True

boxes2 = [[1, 4, 6], [2], [0, 4, 1], [5, 6, 2], [3], [4, 1], [6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes2))  # Output: True

boxes3 = [[1, 4], [2], [0, 4, 1], [3], [], [4, 1], [5, 6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes3))  # Output: False
```

## Algorithm
The program uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the boxes and their keys. It starts with the first box, marks it as visited, and adds its keys to a queue. It continues exploring boxes in the queue until all reachable boxes are visited or the queue becomes empty.

## Concepts and Resources
### Concepts Needed:
- **Lists and List Manipulation**: Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically. ([Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html))
- **Graph Theory Basics**: Knowledge of graph theory, especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search, can be very helpful in solving this problem. ([Graph Theory](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms))
- **Algorithmic Complexity**: Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms. ([Big O Notation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/big-o-notation/))
- **Recursion**: Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys. ([Recursion in Python](https://realpython.com/python-recursion/))
- **Queue and Stack**: Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes. ([Python Queue and Stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-in-python/))
- **Set Operations**: Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process. ([Python Sets](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets))

By reviewing these concepts and utilizing these resources, you will be well-equipped to develop an efficient solution for this project, applying both your algorithmic thinking and Python programming skills.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
To use the `canUnlockAll` function, import it into your Python script and call it with the appropriate list of boxes.
