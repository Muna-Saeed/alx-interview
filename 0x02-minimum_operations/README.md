# 0x02. Minimum Operations
### Minimum Operations

This project aims to develop a solution to the "Minimum Operations" problem, where the objective is to determine the minimum number of operations required to achieve a specific number of characters in a text file using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations.

#### Algorithm

The algorithmic approach involves understanding several key concepts:

1. **Dynamic Programming**: Break down the problem into simpler subproblems and build up the solution iteratively. Resources for dynamic programming are available [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/).

2. **Prime Factorization**: Understand how to perform prime factorization since the problem can be reduced to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number `n`. Resources for prime factorization can be found [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/comp-number-theory/v/prime-factorization).

3. **Code Optimization**: Optimize the solution for efficiency. Refer to resources on [optimizing Python code](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips).

4. **Greedy Algorithms**: Consider using greedy algorithms by choosing the best option at each step. Learn more about greedy algorithms [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms/).

#### Basic Requirements

- **Allowed Editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- **Execution Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.4.3)
- **File Structure**: All files should end with a new line, start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`, and adhere to the PEP 8 style.
- **Documentation**: Code should be well-documented.
- **Executable Files**: All files must be executable.
- **README.md**: A detailed README file is mandatory.

```

#### Usage

To test the solution, execute the `0-main.py` script with the desired input:

```bash
./0-main.py
```

#### Example

```python
n = 4
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))

n = 12
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))
```

Output:
```
Min number of operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min number of operations to reach 12 characters: 7
```

#### Additional Resources

- Further study materials for dynamic programming, prime factorization, Python optimization, and greedy algorithms.

By leveraging these resources and understanding the outlined concepts, developers can effectively tackle the "Minimum Operations" problem, employing both mathematical reasoning and programming skills to find the most efficient solution.
